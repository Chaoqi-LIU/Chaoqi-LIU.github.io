### Refining the Additive Random Noise Detection Method for Adversarial Examples   
*December 2020 -- May 2021*

**Abstract** \
Natural images are virtually surrounded by low-density misclassified regions that can be efficiently discovered by gradient-guided search — enabling the generation of adversarial images — images that an attacker has intentionally designed to cause machine learning models to make mistakes. In this paper, I propose a simple change to the existing additive random noise detection method — a test time method to distinguish adversarial images by testing the robustness of input images. I propose the Ensemble Method of additive random noise detection method where I demonstrate that by testing with different combinations of noise radius (variance) of zero-mean Gaussian noise, there is an increase in detection rate of adversarial images (true positive rate increases when false positive rate is fixed).

### The Social Dilemma workshop
*November 2020*

**Description** \
I watched the Netflix documentary *The Social Dilemma* and was disappointed to find how big companies use personal data at will to profit at the expense of people’s interests. The spread of body shame, youth depression, and mental illness were by-products. This truth toppled my belief, and I felt obligated to warn others of these outcomes. Thus, together with my friend, I initiated a workshop for parents and students to explain the social dilemma in the digital age. As I continued to express my concerns, I could see shocking bewilderment, denial, and even anger in the audience’s faces. The one-hour workshop might not change much, but what I could accomplish was to plant seeds in their minds.
